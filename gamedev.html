				<p>Shafted is a sidescrolling platform adventure game for PC aimed at children from 4-12 years old.  They will play as Rowdy Mulligan, a likable rogue and scallywag, because not all prisoners are bad guys, right? The Shafted prison was built at the bottom of an old gem mine.  What more could an unjustly condemned thief hope for?  As fortune favours the brave, there is a jailbreak and Rowdy must find his freedom whilst filling his pockets with as many gems as possible along the way.  But watch out!  There are guards roaming everywhere.  Maybe some gems can make them look the other way?  Trap doors and runaway mine carts are just some of the obstacles that stand between Rowdy and his freedom. The only thing that is certain, is that someone will get SHAFTED!</p>
				<br>
				<p>Shafted! is my first experience developing a fully-fledged game as part of a team. I was in charge of scripting the game, developing the mechanics and creating the levels while my colleague, Sidonie Cromb, was developing the artwork, sprites, and tiles. Looking back, there are many aspects of the game I could have done better or more efficiently, but I decided to keep this game in its current state to have a frame of reference for my growth as a game developer.</p>
				<p>This game was created as part of the Digital Media course at CQUniversity.</p>
