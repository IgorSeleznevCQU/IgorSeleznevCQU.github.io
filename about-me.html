				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hi, my name is Igor Seleznev and I’m into all things digital. I’m currently undertaking a course in Digital Media at Central Queensland University, and this site is my senior project. My strongest skills are web development, game design, 3D modelling and programming; however, I have competency in other areas of digital media as well, including digital art, animation, and film. I also have a knack for technology and know (or can find) my way around just about any piece of hardware or software. My dream is to become a game developer, alone or as part of a team, but thanks to my multi-faceted skills I can work in a range of different tech-related areas.</p>
