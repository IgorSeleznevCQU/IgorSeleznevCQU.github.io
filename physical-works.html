				<p>Nature Morte, or Still Life, is a well-known exercise in depicting a group of commonplace objects. Being able to realistically convey shapes and tones of something people see every day is a very prized skill.</p>

				<br>
				<p>This piece was created towards the end of my physical art course at CQU. Compared to my first attempt at drawing a self-portrait (which I dare not display here), this is a massive improvement. It is very difficult to depict a realistic human face without sliding into the uncanny valley, and I am quite happy with the result.</p>

				<p>This is a one-point perspective piece depicting a chess game that has been disturbed, with the grandfather clock looming ominously over the board. It was very challenging trying to draw the chess pieces in perspective, but I had fun with this piece nonetheless.</p>
